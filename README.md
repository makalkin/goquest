# GOQUEST

**Goquest** is a small pet-project of mine. Here I learn and improve my **GO** (and other) skills. 

## THE IDEA

The Idea behind **Goquest** is to bring a game element into the everyday life by making activities look like quests
with rewards, trophies, and experience of course.
 
_Player_ is a user who joined the community. One may be a _questgiver_ or an _adventurer_ or both. To make
rewards relevant players are divided into _circles_, so that their progress is not diminished by other, more active
players or currency/experience inflation. Each _player_ can be in multiple _circles_.

_Circle_ is any group: from your family and friends to your event meet up or company. Basically _circles connect_ 
groups of people with similar interests/location/goal. Inside a _circle_ each _player_ has experience and currency, 
both gained through _quests_.

_Quest_ are created by players inside a _circle_, so that they are visible only within it. Each quest has experience 
and currency reward, but can be extended by _questgiver_ to offer extra _trophies_.

This is a simplified version of my idea, because, obviously I alone don't have the time and resources to make it happen.
 I'm not even sure about the _trophies_.


### Things I use

* [GO](https://golang.org/), duh.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for free hosting.
* [Revel](https://revel.github.io) framework for APIs.
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for UI. (not yet, but when I'm confident with APIs)
* Redis for auth checks.
* MongoDB
